=====================================

The installation and use of this script is very simple:

- Edit the included file monitor_ib_health.conf.example for your
  use and place in
  /usr/local/etc/monitor_ib_healt.conf
- Run monitor_ib_health.sh. It will return an output string with
  the health status of the configured IB interfaces. It is on a
  single line for the purpose of using directly in Nagios. The
  return codes correspond to Nagios codes (ok, warning, critical,
  unknown).

=====================================

 Purpose: This script is a health check of IB interfaces on the system.
    It runs the following checks for each interface matching this host
    in the config file:

    local_errors_check
    remote_errors_check
    pci_health_check
    sm_lid_check
    port_active_check
    port_up_check
    port_width_check
    port_speed_check

 Where/How/When: Run on command line to query status

 Return Values:
   Nagios return codes:
   0 -> OK
   1 -> Warning
   2 -> Critical
   3 -> Unknown

 Expected Output: string suitable for Nagios paging:

 Two interfaces with no errors:
   mlx4_1-ib0:OK ;; mlx4_1-ib1:OK ;;

 Two interfaces with IB errors (other end of link has flapped):
   mlx4_1-ib0:WARNING - Direct-attached ddn-d-1 HCA-1 port 2: [LinkDownedCounter == 48] ;; \
   mlx4_1-ib1:WARNING - Direct-attached ddn-d-0 HCA-1 port 2: [LinkDownedCounter == 66] ;;

 Assumptions/Dependencies:

   This script expects the config file to be placed at
     /usr/local/etc/monitor_ib_health.sh
   and to have a matching entry for this host (say oss4):
     oss:mlx4_1:1:40

   If node guids are to be mapped to names, populate this file
     /usr/local/etc/ib_node_name_map.conf

   The format is the following:
      [GUID]      "simple name"
